🤖 AI-Powered Loan Eligibility Advisor<img src="static/loan.png" alt="Project Banner Image" width="100%">Live Demo(Replace with your deployed app's link)📖 IntroductionThis project is a modern, full-stack web application designed to predict loan eligibility. It combines a machine learning model (a Decision Tree trained on historical loan data) with a conversational AI chatbot (powered by Google Gemini) to create a seamless, user-friendly experience.Users can create a secure account, submit their financial details through a simple form, or be guided through the process by an intelligent chatbot. The app provides instant predictions and helpful, actionable advice.This Flask application is an enhanced version of an original Streamlit prototype, rebuilt with a focus on professional UI/UX, security, and scalability.✨ Key FeaturesSecure User Authentication: Full login and registration system using Firebase Authentication.Protected Routes: The Prediction Form and AI Chatbot pages are accessible only to logged-in users.Dual Prediction Methods:Prediction Form: A clean, multi-column form for quick, direct eligibility checks.AI Chatbot Advisor: A conversational, step-by-step guide that collects user data, submits it, and presents the results in a human-friendly way.Hybrid AI Model: Uses Google Gemini for natural language understanding and your model.pkl (a trained Decision Tree) to perform the final, accurate prediction.Modern, Responsive UI: Built with clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a professional look that works on both desktop and mobile.🛠️ Tech StackBackend:Flask (Python Web Framework)Google Gemini (For AI Chatbot conversation and data structuring)Firebase Admin SDK (For server-side token verification)Frontend:HTML5CSS3 (with modern layouts)JavaScript (for auth and API calls)Firebase Auth SDK (For client-side login/register)Machine Learning:Scikit-learn (For the Decision Tree model)Pandas (For data preprocessing)NumPy (For numerical operations)Jupyter Notebook (For model training and experimentation)🚀 How to Run This Project LocallyFollow these steps to set up and run the project on your own machine.1. PrerequisitesPython 3.10 or newerA Google Firebase projectA Google AI Studio API Key (for Gemini)2. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered_loan_eligibility_advisor.git
cd ai-powered_loan_eligibility_advisor
3. Set Up the Python EnvironmentCreate and activate a virtual environment:Bash# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Create a file named requirements.txt and paste the following content into it:# requirements.txt
flask
numpy
google-generativeai
pandas
joblib
scikit-learn
firebase-admin
python-dotenv
Now, install all the dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure FirebaseThere are two Firebase configurations you must complete.A. Server-Side Key (for Flask)Go to your Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> Service accounts.Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON file.Rename this file to serviceAccountKey.json.Place it in the root of your project folder (at the same level as Flask_app.py).B. Client-Side Config (for the UI)Go to your Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> General tab.Scroll down to "Your apps" and select (or create) a Web App (</>).Find the firebaseConfig object.Open templates/layout.html and paste your firebaseConfig object into the script at the bottom of the page, replacing the placeholder.5. Configure Google GeminiGo to Google AI Studio and get your API key.In the root of your project, create a file named .env.Add your API key to this file:GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
6. Run the ApplicationYou're all set! Run the Flask app:Bashflask run
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the application.📈 The Machine Learning ModelThe heart of this project is the model.pkl file, which is a Decision Tree Classifier model trained on the train.csv dataset.The model was built in the practice.ipynb notebook. The process involved:Data Loading: Importing the train.csv dataset.Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (NaN) in columns like Gender, Married, Credit_History, etc.Feature Engineering: Converting categorical data (like Gender, Property_Area) into numerical values.Log Transformation: Applying np.log to skewed data like ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount to normalize their distribution.Training: Training a DecisionTreeClassifier on the cleaned, processed features to predict the Loan_Status column.Exporting: Saving the trained model as model.pkl using pickle.This model is loaded by the Flask app and is used by both the prediction form and the chatbot to generate the final 'Y' or 'N' prediction.🏛️ System ArchitectureThe application uses a hybrid AI approach. The process flow for the chatbot is as follows:A user logs in via Firebase Authentication.The user answers 11 questions from the chatbot.The Flask server collects all 11 answers.The server runs the preprocess_data function and feeds the results into the model.pkl (Decision Tree) to get a prediction (Y or N).The server then sends the user's data and the model's prediction to the Google Gemini API, asking it to write a user-friendly, formatted response.The final, nicely-formatted advice is sent back to the user's chat window.<img src="static/system_architecture.png" alt="System Architecture Diagram" width="100%">🖼️ ScreenshotsHome PageAbout Page<img src="static/loan.png" alt="Home Page" width="400"><img src="static/Project Activity.png" alt="Project Activity Log" width="400">Prediction FormChatbot(Image of your prediction form)(Image of your chatbot interface)LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
